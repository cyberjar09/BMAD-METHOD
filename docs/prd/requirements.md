# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The BI analyst agent shall integrate seamlessly with existing BMAD workflow, executing BI-focused stories created through the established PM→Architect→Story flow **without modifying any existing bmad-core agents, checklists, tasks, templates, or workflows**.

**FR2**: The BI analyst agent shall implement whitelist-based SQL security model, automatically executing SAFE operations (SELECT, WITH, EXPLAIN, DESCRIBE, SHOW, DESC) while requiring user approval for any MUTATION operations.

**FR3**: The BI analyst agent shall provide a tool integration documentation task that systematically discovers and documents BI stack components including data warehouses, BI tools, dbt configurations, and external integrations.

**FR4**: The BI analyst agent shall perform deep-dive analysis of discovered tools, including dbt model compilation for accurate schema/table/column resolution, BI tool API capabilities assessment, and warehouse connection configuration.

**FR5**: The BI analyst agent shall implement git-synchronized domain knowledge management, accumulating business domain mappings and lessons learned from installation baseline forward with conflict resolution through user elicitation.

**FR6**: The BI analyst agent shall generate analysis-appropriate SQL using accumulated domain knowledge, tool-specific optimizations, and dbt model awareness including pre-compilation for accurate references.

**FR7**: The BI analyst agent shall provide multi-layered communication, delivering technical SQL documentation alongside business-friendly analysis summaries for different stakeholder audiences.

**FR8**: The BI analyst agent shall implement extensible MCP server integration capability, detecting and leveraging available BI tool MCP servers while maintaining full functionality without MCP dependencies.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: The BI expansion pack must maintain compatibility with existing BMAD-METHOD core architecture, versioning, and installation processes **without any modifications to bmad-core files**.

**NFR2**: SQL execution safety must be guaranteed through comprehensive operation classification with zero false negatives for mutation detection, ensuring no data warehouse modifications occur without explicit user approval.

**NFR3**: Domain knowledge accumulation shall scale efficiently with manual sharding capability and must not impact agent response times beyond 2x baseline performance as knowledge grows.

**NFR4**: Tool integration documentation shall complete initial BI stack discovery within 15 minutes for typical installations and provide comprehensive deep-dive analysis within 60 minutes per tool.

**NFR5**: The BI analyst agent shall maintain audit logging for all SQL executions, domain knowledge updates, and user interactions to support compliance and debugging requirements.

**NFR6**: Extension architecture must support future MCP server integrations and additional BI tools without requiring core agent modifications or breaking existing functionality.

## Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: **Existing Workflow Compatibility** - BI expansion pack must integrate with current PM, Architect, and Story Management agents **without requiring any modifications to existing agent definitions, workflows, tasks, templates, or checklists in bmad-core**.

**CR2**: **Installation Process Compatibility** - BI expansion pack must follow established expansion pack installation patterns and be manageable through existing `npx bmad-method install` infrastructure **without modifying core installation logic**.

**CR3**: **Template System Compatibility** - BI analyst must utilize existing BMAD template processing system and YAML-based configuration while adding BI-specific templates for analysis deliverables **without modifying core template processing**.

**CR4**: **Version Management Compatibility** - BI expansion pack versioning must integrate with existing semantic release processes and maintain compatibility with core BMAD-METHOD version updates **without requiring changes to core versioning system**.

**CR5**: ****Zero Core Modification** - **CRITICAL**: All BI expansion pack functionality must be completely isolated within the expansion pack directory structure with **zero modifications, additions, or changes to any files in bmad-core/**.
