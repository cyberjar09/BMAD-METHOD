# Epic 1: Business Intelligence Expansion Pack Implementation

**Epic Goal**: Deliver a complete Business Intelligence expansion pack following established BMAD-METHOD patterns, enabling BI workflows through a specialized BI analyst agent with safe SQL execution, tool integration, and evolving domain knowledge **without any modifications to bmad-core**.

**Integration Requirements**: 
- Follows DevOps expansion pack architectural patterns exactly
- Integrates with existing PM→Architect→Story workflow through story consumption only
- BI analyst agent replaces Developer in story execution **without modifying existing agents**
- **Zero modifications to bmad-core files, agents, tasks, templates, workflows, or checklists**

## Phase 1: Core BI Capability (MVP)

## Story 1.1: BI Expansion Pack Foundation

As a **BMAD-METHOD user**,
I want **the BI expansion pack structure following DevOps expansion pack patterns with complete isolation**,
so that **I can install and activate the BI analyst agent without any changes to existing bmad-core functionality**.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Expansion pack directory structure following `bmad-infrastructure-devops` pattern exactly
2. BI analyst agent definition with core persona, commands, and dependencies structure in expansion pack only
3. Configuration file, checklists, data files, and templates completely contained in expansion pack
4. Installation integration with `npx bmad-method install --expansion=bi-analyst` **without modifying core installer**
5. Basic agent activation with `*help`, `*chat-mode`, `*exit` commands working

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: **Zero files modified, added, or referenced in bmad-core/**
- **IV2**: Installation follows existing expansion pack installation patterns exactly without core changes
- **IV3**: Agent commands and structure match DevOps expansion pack conventions completely

## Story 1.2: SQL Safety Framework with Negative Pattern Learning

As a **BI analyst agent**,
I want **comprehensive SQL safety classification with negative pattern recognition**,
so that **I can execute safe operations while learning from both good and bad pattern examples**.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. SQL operation classification following safety levels (SAFE, MUTATION, CONTEXT, BLOCKED)
2. Negative pattern storage - tracking known wrong patterns and why they failed
3. Pattern invalidation mechanism for marking outdated or incorrect approaches
4. Audit logging for all SQL classification decisions and pattern learning
5. Bootstrap mechanism asking user for sample business questions to establish initial patterns

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: **All safety framework code contained within expansion pack only**
- **IV2**: Pattern learning persists using expansion pack file structure only
- **IV3**: No dependencies on or modifications to existing bmad-core safety mechanisms

## Story 1.3a: BI Tool Discovery and Connection

As a **BI analyst agent**,
I want **systematic discovery of BI stack components from architecture documentation**,
so that **I can identify and catalog available tools without modifying existing documentation workflows**.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Discovery task reads existing Architect documentation **without modifying architecture agent or templates**
2. Identification of data warehouses (Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)
3. Detection of BI tools (Metabase, Tableau, Looker, Power BI) from architecture docs
4. Basic connectivity testing for discovered tools (connection string validation)
5. Discovery results documented using **expansion pack templates only**

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: **Discovery reads from but never modifies existing architecture documentation**
- **IV2**: **No modifications to existing Architect agent, tasks, or templates**
- **IV3**: Discovery results stored completely within expansion pack structure

## Story 1.3b: Deep-Dive Tool Integration Analysis

As a **BI analyst agent**,
I want **detailed analysis capabilities for each discovered BI tool**,
so that **I can understand specific configurations and capabilities through expansion pack tasks only**.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. dbt integration: model compilation, profiles analysis, target detection, description extraction
2. Data warehouse analysis: connection configuration, schema discovery, permission assessment  
3. BI tool analysis: API capabilities, environment detection (staging vs prod), authentication setup
4. Configuration extraction with security best practices (secrets management)
5. Integration readiness assessment with actionable setup recommendations

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: **dbt integration reads existing projects without modifying any dbt files**
- **IV2**: **All analysis logic contained within expansion pack tasks only**
- **IV3**: **No dependencies on or modifications to existing bmad-core configuration systems**

## Story 1.4: Domain Knowledge System with Bootstrapping

As a **BI analyst agent**,
I want **domain knowledge management with intelligent bootstrapping**,
so that **I can accumulate business context using expansion pack storage only**.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Domain knowledge storage using git-synchronized file structure **within expansion pack directory only**
2. Bootstrap mechanism: detects empty knowledge, prompts for domain knowledge task execution
3. Business domain mapping persistence (table/column to business concept relationships)
4. Knowledge invalidation: marking patterns as "known wrong" with explanations
5. Conflict detection with user elicitation workflow for knowledge disagreements

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: **All knowledge files stored within `.bmad-bi/` directory structure only**
- **IV2**: **Bootstrap process uses expansion pack tasks exclusively**  
- **IV3**: **No modifications to or dependencies on existing bmad-core knowledge systems**

## Story 1.5: SQL Generation Engine with dbt Awareness

As a **BI analyst agent**,
I want **intelligent SQL generation using accumulated domain knowledge and tool configurations**,
so that **I can deliver accurate, dbt-aware analysis queries using expansion pack capabilities only**.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. SQL generation engine utilizing domain knowledge for business-to-data mapping
2. dbt model pre-compilation for accurate table/column name resolution before SQL generation
3. Tool-specific optimization based on discovered warehouse capabilities
4. Analysis pattern matching for common BI analysis types (trends, correlations, cohorts)  
5. Multi-layered output: technical SQL documentation + business-friendly summaries

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: **Generated SQL uses expansion pack templates and logic exclusively**
- **IV2**: **dbt integration reads but never modifies existing dbt projects**
- **IV3**: **All SQL generation functionality isolated within expansion pack**
