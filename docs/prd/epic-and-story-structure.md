# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: **Phased delivery with granular stories** following DevOps expansion pack patterns **with zero bmad-core modifications**.

**Rationale**: Based on the DevOps expansion pack structure and isolation requirements, this approach:
1. **Follows Established Patterns**: Mirrors DevOps agent structure with specialized tasks, templates, and checklists
2. **Maintains Complete Isolation**: All functionality contained within expansion pack directory
3. **Enables Early Value**: Phase 1 delivers core BI capability quickly
4. **Reduces Risk**: Granular stories with clear dependencies and bootstrap mechanisms
