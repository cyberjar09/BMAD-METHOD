# Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Existing Project Overview
**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis + User-provided brainstorming document

**Current Project State**: 
BMAD-METHOD is a Universal AI Agent Framework implementing "Agentic Agile Driven Development" with comprehensive core development capabilities and expansion packs for specialized domains (game dev, DevOps, creative writing).

## Available Documentation Analysis
**Using existing project analysis** - Comprehensive documentation available including tech stack, architecture, coding standards, and detailed brainstorming session results for BI expansion pack concept.

## Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: 
✅ **New Feature Addition** - Complete BI expansion pack following established patterns

**Enhancement Description**: 
Create Business Intelligence expansion pack (`bmad-bi-analyst`) with specialized BI analyst agent that **inherits existing BMAD workflow** (PM→Architect→BI Analyst instead of Developer) for SQL generation, data warehouse analysis, and domain knowledge accumulation.

**Impact Assessment**:
✅ **Minimal Impact** - New expansion pack with **zero modifications to bmad-core**
- **IN SCOPE**: SQL analysis, domain knowledge, BI tool integration, warehouse querying
- **OUT OF SCOPE**: Data engineering, ETL pipelines (handled by existing Developer agent)
- **INTEGRATION MODEL**: BI analyst replaces Developer in story execution, inherits all other workflow improvements
- **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: **NO MODIFICATIONS** to existing bmad-core agents, checklists, tasks, templates, workflows

## Refined Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
• **Workflow Integration**: BI analyst executes stories created through existing PM→Architect flow without breaking BMAD patterns
• **Safe SQL Execution**: Whitelist-based security model preventing mutations while enabling comprehensive analysis  
• **Tool Integration Documentation**: Systematic discovery and documentation of BI stack (warehouses, tools, dbt, etc.)
• **Domain Knowledge Evolution**: Git-synchronized learning from installation baseline forward (no historical analysis required)
• **Extensible MCP Integration**: Start with zero MCP dependencies, add capability to leverage when available
• ****ZERO bmad-core MODIFICATION**: All changes isolated to expansion pack only**

**Background Context**:
This expansion extends BMAD-METHOD to Business Intelligence workflows while **preserving all existing patterns and making zero changes to bmad-core**. The BI analyst agent slots into the established development cycle, executing BI-focused stories instead of code implementation stories. Key innovation is the tool integration documentation task that systematically learns BI stack architecture.

**Refined Security Model**:
```yaml
SAFE: ["SELECT", "WITH", "EXPLAIN", "DESCRIBE", "SHOW", "DESC"]
MUTATION: ["INSERT", "UPDATE", "DELETE", "CREATE", "DROP", "ALTER", "TRUNCATE", "MERGE", "COPY", "GRANT", "REVOKE", "COMMENT"] 
CONTEXT: ["USE"] # Database/schema switching
BLOCKED: ["SET", "RESET", "REFRESH", "ANALYZE", "MSCK", "OPTIMIZE", "VACUUM"]
```
