# Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing BMAD-METHOD with a Business Intelligence expansion pack (`bmad-bi-analyst`) that creates a **parallel workflow branch** enabling BI-focused development cycles. The BI analyst agent integrates with existing PM→Architect workflows by consuming stories and executing BI analysis tasks, establishing an alternative to the traditional PM→Architect→Developer flow without replacing or modifying existing agents.

**Enhancement Overview:**
- **Type**: Complete expansion pack following DevOps patterns with architectural isolation
- **Integration Model**: Parallel workflow (PM→Architect→BI Analyst) alongside existing development workflow
- **Scope**: SQL analysis, tool integration documentation, domain knowledge accumulation
- **Critical Constraint**: Zero modifications to bmad-core ensuring long-term maintainability

**Architectural Complexity Acknowledgment:**
This enhancement addresses several non-trivial challenges including SQL operation safety classification, multi-tool BI integration, and evolving domain knowledge management. The architecture balances functionality with safety through a whitelist-based SQL execution model and extensible tool integration framework.

**Relationship to Existing Architecture:**
This document supplements existing project architecture by defining a domain-specific workflow branch that leverages current PM and Architect capabilities while adding specialized BI analysis execution. The zero-core-modification constraint ensures system stability and upgrade compatibility, treating this as a foundation for BI capabilities that can evolve without impacting core functionality.

**Foundational Approach Rationale:**
Rather than attempting comprehensive BI platform replacement, this architecture establishes essential BI workflow integration that can expand based on actual usage patterns and requirements, following the principle of building complexity only when needed.
