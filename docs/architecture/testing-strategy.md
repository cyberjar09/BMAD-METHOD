# Testing Strategy

Based on existing BMAD-METHOD patterns and the focus on SQL generation functionality, the BI expansion pack uses a pragmatic testing approach that integrates with current validation methods while ensuring SQL safety and domain knowledge accuracy.

**Integration with Existing Tests:**

**Existing Test Framework Compatibility:**
- **YAML Validation**: Existing `npm run validate` automatically includes BI expansion pack files
- **Template Processing**: BI templates validated through existing BMAD template system
- **Manual Verification**: Task-based testing following established BMAD patterns

**Test Organization Following BMAD Patterns:**
- **Task-Based Testing**: Each BI functionality tested through executable tasks
- **User-Driven Validation**: Manual verification steps built into agent workflows
- **Configuration Testing**: Environment and connection validation through setup tasks

**Enhanced Testing with Error Learning and dbt Integration:**

**User-Guided Pattern Learning:**
