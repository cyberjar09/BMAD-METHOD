# Tech Stack Alignment

**Existing Technology Stack Analysis:**

| Category | Current Technology | Version | Usage in Enhancement | Integration Notes |
|----------|-------------------|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Runtime** | Node.js | Latest LTS | CLI tooling, installation scripts | Maintains existing patterns |
| **Configuration** | YAML | 1.2 | Agent definitions, templates, workflows | Core to expansion pack structure |
| **Documentation** | Markdown | CommonMark | Agent instructions, templates, analysis outputs | Enhanced with BI-specific formatting |
| **Version Control** | Git | 2.x | Domain knowledge persistence, installation tracking | Critical for knowledge management |
| **Package Management** | npm | 8+ | Distribution, installation, dependency management | Follows existing expansion pack model |
| **Template Processing** | Custom YAML Parser | Internal | Document generation, configuration parsing | Validated for BI output compatibility |

**New Technology Additions (Updated with Current Versions):**

| Technology | Version | Purpose | Rationale | Integration Method |
|------------|---------|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **SQL Parser Library** | sql-parser-cst ^0.25.0 | SQL safety classification | Required for whitelist-based security model | npm dependency in expansion pack |
| **dbt CLI Integration** | dbt-core 1.10.x | Model compilation, schema discovery | Current stable release with 12-month support | Python subprocess calls with version validation |
| **Python Runtime** | Python ≥3.9 | dbt compatibility requirement | Required by dbt-core 1.10.6 | Environment validation during installation |
| **Database Drivers** | Warehouse-specific latest | Data warehouse connections | Enable SQL execution against discovered warehouses | Conditional installation based on detected warehouses |

**Technology Alignment Strategy with Risk Mitigation:**

1. **Hybrid Runtime Management**: Node.js primary with Python subprocess for dbt operations, including runtime validation and fallback mechanisms
2. **Version Compatibility Matrix**: Explicit compatibility testing between dbt 1.10.x, Python 3.9+, and warehouse driver combinations  
3. **Security-First Dependency Management**: All new dependencies undergo security scanning before inclusion
4. **Graceful Technology Degradation**: Core BI functionality works without dbt, with enhanced features when available

**Critical Technology Dependencies Addressed:**

- **Python Environment**: Installation process validates Python ≥3.9 availability before dbt integration
- **Database Driver Licensing**: Documentation clearly identifies enterprise driver licensing requirements
- **Version Drift Management**: Quarterly compatibility testing with dbt release cycle
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Tested installation paths for macOS, Linux, Windows environments
