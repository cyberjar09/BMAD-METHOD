# Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

**Enhanced Integration Strategy with Critical Insights:**

The BI expansion pack integrates through a **hybrid workflow model** that acknowledges the iterative nature of BI analysis while maintaining architectural isolation. Rather than pure sequential consumption, the integration supports both story-driven execution and exploratory analysis feedback loops.

**Refined Integration Points:**

1. **Story Handoff Mechanism**: 
   - **BI-Specific Story Format**: Stories must include data context (sources, business metrics, analysis scope)
   - **Fallback Procedure**: When stories lack BI context, BI analyst initiates discovery tasks to gather requirements
   - **Iterative Feedback**: BI analysis results can inform PM story refinement through documented findings

2. **Architecture Document Integration**:
   - **Required BI Context**: Architecture documents must include data architecture sections (warehouses, schemas, tool configurations)
   - **Validation Mechanism**: BI analyst validates architecture completeness and requests amendments when data context is missing
   - **Bidirectional Updates**: BI tool discovery can inform architecture document updates (read-only consumption with recommendations)

3. **Template System Validation**:
   - **BI Output Support**: Validated support for SQL code blocks, tabular data, and query results in YAML templates  
   - **Dynamic Content Handling**: Template system enhanced to support variable-length analysis outputs
   - **Fallback Formats**: Plain markdown generation when YAML templates cannot accommodate BI-specific content

4. **Workflow Dependency Management**:
   - **Installation Order**: BI expansion pack validates architecture document structure during installation
   - **Missing Context Handling**: Graceful degradation when PM or Architect outputs lack BI requirements
   - **Circular Dependency Resolution**: BI insights feed back to PM through recommendation reports, not direct workflow modification

**Integration Failure Scenarios and Mitigations:**

| Failure Scenario | Mitigation Strategy |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Stories lack BI context | BI analyst executes discovery task to gather requirements |
| Architecture missing data sections | BI analyst documents findings and provides architecture recommendations |
| Template system limitations | Fallback to markdown with structured formatting |
| Workflow timing conflicts | BI analyst operates in parallel with recommendation outputs |

**Boundary Clarification with Edge Case Handling:**

- **BI Analyst Scope**: SQL analysis, domain knowledge, tool integration documentation, business metric discovery
- **Data Engineering Boundary**: When BI analysis identifies ETL needs, generates recommendations for Developer agent rather than implementing
- **Architecture Influence**: BI discoveries inform but do not modify architecture decisions; recommendations provided through separate reports
- **Exploratory vs Structured**: Supports both story-driven structured analysis and exploratory data investigation

**Integration Approach Rationale:**
This hybrid model balances the iterative nature of BI work with the structured workflow patterns of BMAD-METHOD. By supporting both consumption and exploration modes, the architecture accommodates the reality that BI requirements often emerge through analysis rather than being fully specified upfront.
