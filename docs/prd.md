# BMAD-METHOD Business Intelligence Expansion Pack PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview
**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis + User-provided brainstorming document

**Current Project State**: 
BMAD-METHOD is a Universal AI Agent Framework implementing "Agentic Agile Driven Development" with comprehensive core development capabilities and expansion packs for specialized domains (game dev, DevOps, creative writing).

### Available Documentation Analysis
**Using existing project analysis** - Comprehensive documentation available including tech stack, architecture, coding standards, and detailed brainstorming session results for BI expansion pack concept.

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: 
✅ **New Feature Addition** - Complete BI expansion pack following established patterns

**Enhancement Description**: 
Create Business Intelligence expansion pack (`bmad-bi-analyst`) with specialized BI analyst agent that **inherits existing BMAD workflow** (PM→Architect→BI Analyst instead of Developer) for SQL generation, data warehouse analysis, and domain knowledge accumulation.

**Impact Assessment**:
✅ **Minimal Impact** - New expansion pack with **zero modifications to bmad-core**
- **IN SCOPE**: SQL analysis, domain knowledge, BI tool integration, warehouse querying
- **OUT OF SCOPE**: Data engineering, ETL pipelines (handled by existing Developer agent)
- **INTEGRATION MODEL**: BI analyst replaces Developer in story execution, inherits all other workflow improvements
- **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: **NO MODIFICATIONS** to existing bmad-core agents, checklists, tasks, templates, workflows

### Refined Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
• **Workflow Integration**: BI analyst executes stories created through existing PM→Architect flow without breaking BMAD patterns
• **Safe SQL Execution**: Whitelist-based security model preventing mutations while enabling comprehensive analysis  
• **Tool Integration Documentation**: Systematic discovery and documentation of BI stack (warehouses, tools, dbt, etc.)
• **Domain Knowledge Evolution**: Git-synchronized learning from installation baseline forward (no historical analysis required)
• **Extensible MCP Integration**: Start with zero MCP dependencies, add capability to leverage when available
• ****ZERO bmad-core MODIFICATION**: All changes isolated to expansion pack only**

**Background Context**:
This expansion extends BMAD-METHOD to Business Intelligence workflows while **preserving all existing patterns and making zero changes to bmad-core**. The BI analyst agent slots into the established development cycle, executing BI-focused stories instead of code implementation stories. Key innovation is the tool integration documentation task that systematically learns BI stack architecture.

**Refined Security Model**:
```yaml
SAFE: ["SELECT", "WITH", "EXPLAIN", "DESCRIBE", "SHOW", "DESC"]
MUTATION: ["INSERT", "UPDATE", "DELETE", "CREATE", "DROP", "ALTER", "TRUNCATE", "MERGE", "COPY", "GRANT", "REVOKE", "COMMENT"] 
CONTEXT: ["USE"] # Database/schema switching
BLOCKED: ["SET", "RESET", "REFRESH", "ANALYZE", "MSCK", "OPTIMIZE", "VACUUM"]
```

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Core BMAD-METHOD Stack**:
- **Languages**: Node.js (tooling), YAML (configuration), Markdown (templates/documentation)
- **Frameworks**: Natural language agent framework, YAML-driven template processing
- **Database**: File-based knowledge storage, Git-based version control
- **Infrastructure**: CLI-based installation, npm distribution, semantic release automation
- **External Dependencies**: Git, Node.js runtime, optional MCP server ecosystem

**BI Expansion Pack Additional Stack**:
- **Data Warehouses**: Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift (configurable)
- **BI Tools**: Metabase, Tableau, Looker, Power BI (extensible via MCP)
- **Data Transformation**: dbt (detection and integration)
- **Database Connectivity**: SQL Alchemy, JDBC drivers, cloud SDK libraries

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: 
- File-based domain knowledge storage following BMAD patterns (`.bmad-bi/domain-knowledge/`)
- Git-synchronized learning logs with timestamped entries
- Warehouse connections through environment variables and configuration files
- dbt integration through local dbt CLI for model compilation and metadata extraction

**API Integration Strategy**:
- BI tool APIs accessed through documented REST endpoints with API key authentication
- MCP server integration when available, direct API calls as fallback
- Warehouse APIs for metadata queries and connection testing
- Personal collection creation in BI tools for safe testing before user migration

**Frontend Integration Strategy**:
- CLI-based agent interaction maintaining existing BMAD patterns
- Markdown-based analysis report generation using template system
- Story-driven workflow execution through existing Scrum Master coordination
- **NO modifications to existing CLI or agent interfaces**

**Testing Integration Strategy**:
- SQL execution safety testing through operation classification validation
- BI tool integration testing in sandbox/staging environments
- Domain knowledge persistence testing through git commit verification
- MCP server integration testing with fallback validation

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**:
```
expansion-packs/bmad-bi-analyst/
├── agents/bi-analyst.md
├── tasks/document-bi-integration.md
├── tasks/execute-safe-sql.md
├── tasks/accumulate-domain-knowledge.md
├── templates/bi-analysis-report-tmpl.yaml
├── checklists/bi-analyst-checklist.md
├── data/sql-safety-rules.md
└── config.yaml
```

**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing BMAD expansion pack patterns with `bi-` prefix for BI-specific components

**Coding Standards**: Natural language instructions in Markdown, YAML configuration following existing bmad-core patterns, consistent template variable naming (`{{warehouse_type}}`, `{{bi_tool_config}}`)

**Documentation Standards**: Comprehensive task documentation with elicitation requirements, template usage examples, safety model documentation

**CRITICAL ISOLATION CONSTRAINT**: **All BI functionality must be contained within `expansion-packs/bmad-bi-analyst/` directory with zero files added, modified, or referenced in `bmad-core/`**

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Leverages existing `npm run build` expansion pack bundling, web-builder.js integration for agent packaging **without modifying build scripts**

**Deployment Strategy**: 
- npm distribution following existing expansion pack model
- `npx bmad-method install --expansion=bi-analyst` installation command
- Git-based knowledge storage initialization on first installation
- Environment variable configuration for warehouse and BI tool connections

**Monitoring and Logging**: 
- SQL execution audit logging to `.bmad-bi/logs/sql-audit.log`
- Domain knowledge change tracking through git commit history
- BI tool API interaction logging for debugging and compliance
- Performance metrics for query execution times and knowledge lookup speeds

**Configuration Management**:
- Environment-based configuration for warehouse connections
- `.bmad-bi/config/bi-tools.yaml` for BI tool configurations
- Git-ignored secrets management for API keys and connection strings
- dbt profiles integration for target and connection configuration

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

- **Version Conflicts**: Mitigated through semantic versioning and compatibility testing

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive testing suite for SQL safety classification
- Sandbox environment requirements for initial BI tool integration
- Rollback capabilities for domain knowledge changes
- Extensive documentation and troubleshooting guides
- **Strict architectural review ensuring zero bmad-core modifications**
