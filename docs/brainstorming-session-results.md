- Git-synchronized learning and knowledge evolution
- Tiered mutation boundaries for safe automation
- Schema evolution recommendations without direct implementation
- Multi-layered communication (technical + lay person)

## Technique Sessions

### First Principles Thinking - 25 minutes

**Description:** Breaking down BI analyst agent to fundamental, irreducible capabilities

**Ideas Generated:**
1. **Trustworthy data-to-business mapping** - Establishing correct pathways between business concepts and warehouse tables/columns once, then reusing
2. **Analysis pattern library with clarification loops** - Pattern matching analysis types to SQL techniques, defaulting to elicitation when ambiguous
3. **Question decomposition** - Converting open-ended business questions into specific, targeted analysis requirements  
4. **Interactive clarification** - Brainstorming dialogue capabilities with business stakeholders
5. **Data capability assessment** - Evaluating if warehouse can answer specific questions
6. **Alternative pathfinding** - Suggesting viable alternatives when data limitations exist
7. **Audience-adaptive communication** - Technical reports for experts, lay person summaries for stakeholders
8. **Query documentation** - Human-readable breakdowns of complex SQL
9. **Opportunity pattern recognition** - Analyzing results to identify business improvement opportunities
10. **Recommendation scope validation** - Understanding what's possible within analyzed data vs requiring new data requests
11. **Proactive suggestion elicitation** - Offering specific recommendation areas based on analysis

**Insights Discovered:**
- All fundamental functions follow pattern: "Intelligent interpretation â†’ guided exploration â†’ validated execution"
- Core cognitive capability is "mapping with validation" across multiple domains
- Elicitation and clarification are critical for ambiguity resolution
- Documentation and communication must be multi-layered for different audiences

**Notable Connections:**
- Business context mapping parallels technical schema understanding
- Analysis pattern matching mirrors the template-based approach in BMAD core
- Interactive clarification aligns with existing BMAD agent interaction patterns

### Assumption Reversal - 15 minutes

**Description:** Challenging core assumptions about BI analyst design to uncover better approaches

**Ideas Generated:**
1. **Git-synchronized learning** - Timestamped domain knowledge with commit tracking for delta-based bootstrapping
2. **Tiered mutation boundaries** - Analysis artifacts auto-commit to isolated folders, production changes require confirmation
3. **Schema evolution recommendations** - Comprehensive proposals for warehouse optimization without direct implementation
4. **Fresh rediscovery benefits** - Understanding value of starting clean vs persistent memory trade-offs

**Insights Discovered:**
- Assumption reversal revealed hybrid approaches superior to binary choices
- Git integration solves knowledge staleness problem elegantly
- Mutation boundaries need to be context-aware, not just operation-based
- Recommendation without implementation maintains safety while providing value

**Notable Connections:**
- Git-based learning sync aligns with BMAD's version-controlled template approach
- Schema recommendations follow BMAD pattern of documentation-first, implementation-later
- Tiered boundaries mirror BMAD's separation of planning vs execution agents
